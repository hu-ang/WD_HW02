hw02.xiaohulaoer.com

3. What's the link to your repository on github with your code?

4. How many HTML / CSS tutorial exercises did you do?
Almost all the HTML ones, but then I was taking too much time and did
like maybe ~50% of the remaining ones? I think skimming through and 
seeing the available functionality that might come in handy later was good.

5. How comfortable do you feel with HTML and CSS now?
Decently? I think I would still have a tab open to search for 
attributes though.


6. How many JS tutorial exercises did you do?
~50%

7. How comfortable do you feel with JS now?
There's still a lot to learn  I feel? Also I definitely would go through the tutorial a bit more.

8. Do all of your HTML pages pass the W3C HTML validator?
(https://validator.w3.org/)
Yes


9. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
Just figuring out how to approach the calculator problem? I would have spent a lot more time wasted fighting for one approach before talking it out with my roommate and finding a different solution.
